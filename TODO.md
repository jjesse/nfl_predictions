# NFL Predictions App - TODO List

This file tracks the proposed improvements for the NFL Predictions application.

## Hosting Compatibility Notes:
- ‚úÖ = Works on GitHub Pages (static hosting)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è = Requires backend/server (Vercel, Netlify Functions, etc.)
- üö´ = Requires full server/database (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

---

## Phase 1: Code Structure and Organization ‚úÖ

- [x] **Modularize JavaScript:**
  - [x] Create `modules` directory.
  - [x] Split `script.js` into smaller, more focused modules:
    - [x] `ui.js`: Functions that directly manipulate the DOM (e.g., `showTab`, `loadNFCTeams`).
    - [x] `api.js`: Functions for handling data, including `fetch` and `localStorage` operations (e.g., `loadExternalData`, `savePrediction`).
    - [x] `validation.js`: All validation-related functions.
    - [x] `main.js` or `app.js`: The main entry point that initializes the application.
- [x] **Use ES6 Modules:**
  - [x] Update `index.html` to load the main script as a module (`<script type="module" src="..."></script>`).
  - [x] Use `import` and `export` statements to manage dependencies between the new modules.

## Phase 2: HTML and CSS Improvements ‚úÖ

- [x] **Refactor HTML:**
  - [x] Remove inline styles from `index.html` (e.g., the `style` attribute on the `h2` tag) and move them to `styles.css`.
  - [x] Use more semantic HTML tags, such as `<section>` for tab content and `<article>` for team prediction areas.
- [x] **Refactor CSS:**
  - [x] Use CSS Variables for colors, fonts, and spacing to make the theme easier to manage.
  - [x] Refactor redundant styles to reduce code duplication.
  - [x] Improve responsive design for a better experience on tablets.

## Phase 3: JavaScript Logic and Features ‚úÖ

- [x] **State Management:**
  - [x] Implement a simple state management object to hold the application's state (e.g., current tab, predictions, results).
  - [x] Refactor functions to read from and update the state object instead of global variables.
- [x] **Data-Driven UI:**
  - [x] Create functions that render UI components based on the application state, rather than building HTML strings directly in functions like `loadNFCTeams`.
- [x] **Event Delegation:**
  - [x] Refactor event listeners to use event delegation. For example, add a single click listener to the `.tabs` container instead of each `.tab-button`.
- [x] **Performance:**
  - [x] Debounce or throttle event listeners on frequently triggered events, like the `input` event on number fields, to improve performance.

## Phase 4: Development and Tooling ‚úÖ

- [x] **Linting and Formatting:**
  - [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent code style and catch common errors.
  - [x] Add a `package.json` script to run the linter and formatter.
- [x] **Bundler (Optional, for future growth):**
  - [x] Integrate simple build script for managing assets and creating distribution files.
- [x] **Expand `package.json` Scripts:**
  - [x] Add scripts for common development tasks, such as starting a development server and building the project for production.

## Phase 5: Automated Results and Comparison System ‚úÖ

- [x] **Remove Manual Results Entry:** ‚úÖ
  - [x] Remove the "Enter Results" tab from the UI since results will be pulled automatically.
  - [x] Update navigation and ensure all functionality still works without the results tab.
  - [x] Clean up any unused functions related to manual results entry.
- [x] **Automated Results Fetching:** ‚úÖ
  - [x] Implement API integration with NFL/ESPN APIs to fetch game results automatically.
  - [x] Create a data fetching service that runs on schedule to get finalized game results.
  - [x] Add error handling for API failures and data inconsistencies.
- [x] **Scheduled Updates:** ‚úÖ
  - [x] Set up automated comparison updates every Tuesday at 3:00 AM Eastern Time.
  - [x] Ensure all games are finalized before fetching results (Tuesday morning after Monday night games).
  - [x] Implement data validation to ensure fetched results are accurate and complete.
- [x] **GitHub Actions Automation:** ‚úÖ
  - [x] Create a GitHub Action workflow that runs every Tuesday at 3:00 AM ET.
  - [x] Configure the workflow to fetch latest NFL results and update comparisons.
  - [x] Add notifications for successful updates and error alerts.
- [x] **Data Persistence and Backup:** ‚úÖ
  - [x] Implement proper data versioning for results and predictions.
  - [x] Add backup mechanisms for critical data.
  - [x] Create data migration scripts for any schema changes.
- [x] **Comparison Enhancements:** ‚úÖ
  - [x] Improve comparison UI to show more detailed statistics.
  - [x] Add historical comparison data and trends.
  - [x] Implement comparison filtering and sorting options.
